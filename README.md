## Installation & loading

captcha-image is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/iktbd/captcha-image) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install captcha-image. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"iktbd/captcha-image": "^2.00"
```

or run

```sh
composer require iktbd/captcha-image
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of captcha-image.

# Use the captcha-image

### Create captcher

```php
<?php
use Iktbd\CaptchaImage\Captcha;

//Set your password as your wish
$password='djhfhdfywh53477';

//Create new captcha
$src_string=Captcha::create($password);


```

### Use the $src_string in the html image

```html

<form id="" action="#" method="post">
<img src="{{$src_string}}" height="50" width="250">
<input type="text" name="captcha_text" value="">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

```

### Varify Captcha data

```php

<?php
use Iktbd\CaptchaImage\Captcha;


//Set your same password
$password='djhfhdfywh53477';

//Get the input value from the form submit
$text=$_POST['captcha_text'];

//Check submitted captcha data
$result=Captcha::verify($password,$text);

if($result==true)
{
    echo 'Captcha is correct';
}
else
{
    echo 'Captcha is wrong';
}


```


## Note

- If you want to create a new captcha and verify your old submitted captcha then verify your old submitted captcha first then create new captcha
- You should remember that every new captcha generate a new session and delete the old session.
- So, if you create a new captcha than if you verify the old submitted captcha then it will return false. Because the old captcha data already deleted when you create a new captcha
